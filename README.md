Goal of the Project:

To provide better Airline and AirPort services and to avoid delays in Air Travel across different locations at Municipality level. The aim is to provide airports, airlines, and the travelling public with a neutral, third-party view of which airlines are delivering on their promise to get passengers from Point A to Point B on-time.
